## Long story

<div style="text-align: justify">
There are two types of people: those who are fascinated with something and those who are not. Passion is something that affects your life in so many ways. It can not only determine how do you spend your free time, but also what is your job, who are your friends and which books do you read. This blog was created to share thoughts about my lifelong passion - software engineering.

<br/>

I live in Warsaw, Poland and currently work for Sumo Logic as a Cloud Software Engineer. Previously I worked for a Chicago-based hedge fund and conducted research and implemented algorithmic trading strategies. I really liked the research and development approach, but also always wanted to join some Silicon Valley startup. That's why I didn't have to think twice when an offer from Sumo appeared.

My technical areas of interest changed many times in the past. In high school I was mainly interested in IT security. During studies I was fascinated by operating systems internals and low level programming. At the same time, I was also very interested in functional programming and JVM and it's languages. After joining the Algorithmic Trading and Smart Execution Team at TradeLink, I started learning more about statistics and machine learning algorithms. Currently, I'm mainly interested in distributed systems and cloud computing. I still love solving algorithmic problems, JVM languages (especially Scala) and functional programming.

I'm very curious about the world around me. That's why, I love to try out new things, meet interesting people and travel. At the age of 18, I created a list of 50 places in the world that I want to see. Every year I visit some of them. In my spare time, I like doing some sports and reading books.
